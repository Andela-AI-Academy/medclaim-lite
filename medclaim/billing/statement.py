# billing/statement.py
# ============================================================================
# ORIGINAL BUILD (2018). The statement engine. build_statement() does the lot:
# pulls the patient, pulls their claims, aggregates charges/adjustments/payments,
# resolves the payer contract, estimates allowed amounts, groups and RENDERS the
# statement text, and writes a statements row. One function. No tests. Every
# engineer who inherited it decided today was not the day.
#
# Money is in CENTS throughout. Some comments below say dollars. They are wrong
# and have been wrong for years -- trust the integers, not the comments.
